# Notify an SNS Topic When Certain IAM or SSO User or Group Events Occur #

Specifically, the SNS topic is notified when a new IAM or SSO user is created
or deleted, a user is added or removed from a group, or a group is created or
deleted.

## Usage ##

To run this example you need to execute the `terraform init` command
followed by the `terraform apply` command.

Note that this example may create resources which cost money. Run
`terraform destroy` when you no longer need these resources.
